This is a clone of the Stack-Overflow website made by me and my partner Adisri Rajkumar. We utilized the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) framework to build this application that has functionalities such as (but not limited to) asking/answering/tagging questions, user authentication, administrator functions, commenting, and searching. This was our semester project and I learned a lot about right and wrong ways to build a web application based on your goals. CSS and certain functionalities may be edited and improved over time, as this is my personal repo.




Startup Instructions:

1) in a new terminal, enter "mongod --bind_ip 127.0.0.1", assuming you have mongoDB setup
2) in another terminal, cd into the repository directory, and again into server. Then enter "node init.js <admin-email> <admin-password>" we suggest using admin@example.com and password, but whatever works for you.
3) in that same terminal (or a new one, you just have to be in the server directory) enter the command "npm start secret"
4) in a new terminal, cd into the repo directory and again into client, then enter "npm run start" to run the react app

#Instructions to Start-up#

in a new terminal, enter "mongod --bind_ip 127.0.0.1", assuming you have mongoDB setup
in another terminal, cd into the repository directory, and again into server. Then enter "node init.js " we suggest using admin@example.com and password, but whatever works for you.
in that same terminal (or a new one, you just have to be in the server directory) enter the command "npm start secret"
in a new terminal, cd into the repo directory and again into client, then enter "npm run start" to run the react app
